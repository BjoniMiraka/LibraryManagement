## 🚫 Common Misunderstandings - CLARIFIED

### ❌ "Can I read the book online after borrowing?"
**NO.** This system only tracks physical books. After you click "Borrow," you must go to the library to pick up the actual book. You cannot read it on your computer or phone.

### ❌ "Will the book be delivered to my house?"
**NO.** You must go to the library to pick it up yourself. The system just reserves it for you.

### ❌ "Can I download the book as a PDF?"
**NO.** This is not a digital library. These are real, physical books made of paper.

### ❌ "Why do I need to return it?"
Because it's a physical book that belongs to the library. Other people want to read it too!

### ✅ "So it's like reserving a book online and picking it up?"
**YES! Exactly!** You reserve it online, pick it up from the library, read the physical book at home, then return the physical book to the library.
